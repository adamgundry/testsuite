    Couldn't match expected type `TFn a' with actual type `TFn a0'
    NB: `TFn' is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable `a0' is ambiguous
    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    When checking that `x' has the inferred type `forall a. TFn a'
    Probable cause: the inferred type is ambiguous
    In the expression:
      do { let Just x = ...;
           let n = fst x + fst x;
           return () }
    In an equation for `f':
