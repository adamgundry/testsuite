T5287.hs:6:29:
    No instance for (A e oops)
      arising from the 'deriving' clause of a data type declaration
    The type variable `oops' is ambiguous
    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    Note: there is a potential instance available:
      instance A Int Bool -- Defined at T5287.hs:7:10
    Possible fix:
      use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
        so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (Read (E e))
