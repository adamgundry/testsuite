    Constructor `Bar' does not have field `baz'
    In the pattern: Bar {flag = f, baz = b}
    In the pattern: State {bar = Bar {flag = f, baz = b}}
    In an equation for `display':
        display (State {bar = Bar {flag = f, baz = b}}) = print (f, b)

tcfail083.hs:8:53:
    No instance for (Show t0) arising from a use of `print'
    The type variable `t0' is ambiguous
    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    Relevant bindings include b :: t0 (bound at tcfail083.hs:8:45)
    Note: there are several potential instances:
      instance Show Bar -- Defined at tcfail083.hs:3:43
      instance Show Double -- Defined in `GHC.Float'
      instance Show Float -- Defined in `GHC.Float'
      ...plus 24 others
    In the expression: print (f, b)
    In an equation for `display':
        display (State {bar = Bar {flag = f, baz = b}}) = print (f, b)
