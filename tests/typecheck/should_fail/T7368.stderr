    Kind incompatibility when matching types:
      c0 :: (* -> *) -> *
      (->) a0 :: * -> *
    Expected type: a0 -> b0
      Actual type: c0 Maybe
    In the return type of a call of ‛l’
    Probable cause: ‛l’ is applied to too many arguments
    In the first argument of ‛b’, namely ‛(l Nothing)’
    In the expression: b (l Nothing)
