    Couldn't match kind ‛* -> *’ with ‛*’
    When matching types
      b1 :: * -> *
      b0 :: *
    Expected type: a0 -> b0
      Actual type: c0 b1
    In the return type of a call of ‛l’
    Probable cause: ‛l’ is applied to too many arguments
    In the first argument of ‛b’, namely ‛(l ())’
    In the expression: b (l ())
