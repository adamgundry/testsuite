T7368.hs:3:10:
    Couldn't match kind `* -> *' with `*'
    When matching types
      c0 :: (* -> *) -> *
      (->) a0 :: * -> *
    Expected type: a0 -> b0
      Actual type: c0 b1
    In the return type of a call of `l'
    Probable cause: `l' is applied to too many arguments
    In the first argument of `b', namely `(l ())'
    In the expression: b (l ())

T7368.hs:3:13:
    Couldn't match type `()' with `b0 a1'
    Expected type: b1 a1
      Actual type: ()
    In the first argument of `l', namely `()'
    In the first argument of `b', namely `(l ())'
    In the expression: b (l ())
