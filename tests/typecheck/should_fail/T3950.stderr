    Couldn't match kind `* -> *' with `*'
    When matching types
      w :: (* -> * -> *) -> *
      Sealed :: (* -> *) -> *
    Expected type: w (Id p)
      Actual type: Sealed (Id p0 x0)
    In the first argument of `Just', namely rp'
    In the expression: Just rp'
    In an equation for `rp':
        rp _
          = Just rp'
          where
              rp' :: Sealed (Id p x)
              rp' = undefined
