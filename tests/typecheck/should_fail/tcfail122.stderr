    Kind incompatibility when matching types:
      c0 :: (* -> *) -> *
      a0 :: * -> *
    Expected type: a0 b0
      Actual type: c0 d0
    Relevant bindings include
      foo :: [a0 b0] (bound at tcfail122.hs:7:1)
    In the expression:
        undefined :: forall (c :: (* -> *) -> *) (d :: * -> *). c d
    In the expression:
      [undefined :: forall a b. a b,
       undefined :: forall (c :: (* -> *) -> *) (d :: * -> *). c d]
    In an equation for ‛foo’:
        foo
          = [undefined :: forall a b. a b,
             undefined :: forall (c :: (* -> *) -> *) (d :: * -> *). c d]
