    Couldn't match type `a' with `t a'
      `a' is a rigid type variable bound by
          a type expected by the context: [a] -> [t a] at mc22.hs:10:9
    Expected type: [a] -> [t a]
      Actual type: [a] -> [a]
    Relevant bindings include foo :: [t [Char]] (bound at mc22.hs:8:1)
    In the return type of a call of `take'
    In the expression: take 5
    In a stmt of a monad comprehension: then group using take 5
