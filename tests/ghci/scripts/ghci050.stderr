    Couldn't match expected type ‛ListableElem (a, a)’
                with actual type ‛a’
      ‛a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the instance declaration at <interactive>:6:10
    Relevant bindings include
      asList :: (a, a) -> [ListableElem (a, a)]
        (bound at <interactive>:6:33)
      a :: a (bound at <interactive>:6:41)
      b :: a (bound at <interactive>:6:43)
    In the expression: a
    In the expression: [a, b]
    In an equation for ‛asList’: asList (a, b) = [a, b]
